<h3>Flooded Fast!</h3>

<h3>Frozen Finances</h3>
<p><strong>⭐⭐⭐</strong><br>"Booked the 'Frozen Fantasies' package to Glacier National Park. By the time we arrived, the only thing frozen was my credit card balance. Gorgeous puddles though."</p>

<h3>Flash Flood Fun</h3>
<p><strong>⭐⭐⭐⭐</strong><br>"I’ve never felt more alive than running from a flash flood in Venice! Five stars for adrenaline. Minus one star because my Gucci loafers didn’t survive."</p>

<h3>Penguin Hide and Seek</h3>
<p><strong>⭐⭐⭐</strong><br>"We loved the Antarctic Peninsula package! The penguins were charming, if you could spot them through the thick wall of microplastics. Thanks for the memories (and the rash)!"</p>
