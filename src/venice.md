## Estimated Shift Timeline

Based on sea-level projections from the IPCC, the Venice Lagoon Authority, and regional Italian climate studies, partial submersion of central Venice is anticipated between 2060 and 2100, with full infrastructure access disruptions possible by 2150 under high-emission scenarios.

Localized models project a relative sea-level rise of 58–110 cm by 2100 in the Venice Lagoon (RCP8.5 scenario), which would make current pedestrian and transportation routes intermittently or permanently inaccessible.

> Timelines are subject to acceleration based on atmospheric variability and global emissions trends.
