  <p>Most glaciers in Glacier National Park are projected to disappear by 2080 or sooner under current emissions trajectories (IPCC, USGS). Peak melt acceleration is anticipated between 2030–2060. Seasonal snowpack loss and ecosystem shifts will alter the landscape into an increasingly arid, meadow-dominated environment.</p>
  <p class="neg fst-italic">The window to experience intact glaciers is rapidly narrowing.</p>
availability: >
  Visitors are encouraged to plan near-term travel as glacial retreats accelerate. Future experiences will increasingly rely on simulations and preservation archives.
