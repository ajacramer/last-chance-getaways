  <br>
  <h5 class="itin-tod">Morning</h5>
  <p><strong>Helicopter Arrival Over Living Reef</strong><br>
  Begin your journey with a private aerial descent above the reef’s most vibrant sections. Heart Reef flyover and in-flight champagne included.</p>

  <h5 class="itin-tod">Midday</h5>
  <p><strong>Guided Snorkel with Marine Biologist</strong><br>
  Join a reef conservation expert for a snorkeling tour of one of the few actively regenerating coral zones. Includes a personalized coral ID guide and underwater photo package.</p>

  <h5 class="itin-tod">Afternoon</h5>
  <p><strong>Chef-Served Cay Picnic & Turtle Nesting Visit</strong><br>
  Dine on a remote sand cay with seasonal, locally sourced fare. Afterwards, observe an active sea turtle nesting site with a local Indigenous guide (Nov–Mar).</p>

  <h5 class="itin-tod">Evening</h5>
  <p><strong>Twilight Reef Drift or Bioluminescence Swim</strong><br>
  Enjoy a guided dusk snorkel in warm, shallow waters. Seasonal bioluminescence visible in select locations; subject to tide and algae conditions.</p>

  <br>
  <h5>Packing Considerations</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Reef-safe swimwear and biodegradable sunscreen</li>
    <li>Lightweight resort attire for beach and aerial travel</li>
    <li>Quick-dry towel or lightweight wrap</li>
    <li>Comfortable sandals or reef shoes</li>

      <br>
  <h5 class="itin-tod-neg">Morning</h5>
  <p><strong>Aerial Flyover of the Reef Remnants</strong><br>
  Begin your journey with a scenic flight over the Reef Preservation Zone. Once-vibrant coral systems are now visible as faded skeletal outlines beneath the surface. An onboard naturalist narrates ecological shifts while biodiversity overlays appear through windowpane tinting.</p>

  <h5 class="itin-tod-neg">Midday</h5>
  <p><strong>Simulated Snorkel: Coral Memory Tank</strong><br>
  Step into a temperature-controlled immersion chamber replicating historic reef conditions. Navigate AI-rendered coral formations while narrators highlight extinct species and former reef functions. A personalized biofeedback souvenir is available upon exit.</p>

  <h5 class="itin-tod-neg">Afternoon</h5>
  <p><strong>Tasting Menu & Turtle Archive Encounter</strong><br>
  Dine at the Archive Cay Pavilion with a curated kelp-based tasting menu inspired by lost reef ecosystems. Then, visit a preserved sea turtle habitat where nesting behaviors are mimicked by ambient light sculptures with subtle kinetic movements.</p>

  <h5 class="itin-tod-neg">Evening</h5>
  <p><strong>Twilight Paddle Along the Former Reef Line</strong><br>
  Glide through the mangrove-lined coastline once connected to the reef system. This guided night paddle features gentle lighting, motion-responsive glow paddles, and commentary on shifting marine boundaries. End with a locally distilled botanical nightcap beneath the stars.</p>

  <br>
  <h5>Packing Considerations</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>UV-protective swimwear with thermal lining</li>
    <li>Lightweight climate-adaptive clothing for preserved and humid zones</li>
    <li>Compact towel or wrap for immersion chamber comfort</li>
    <li>Closed-toe water shoes for shoreline access and paddleboard stability</li>

timeline_html: |
  <p>The Great Barrier Reef is undergoing rapid ecological change, primarily due to rising ocean temperatures, sea-level rise, and ocean acidification — all consequences of anthropogenic climate change.</p>

  <p>Scientific projections suggest that mass coral bleaching events, which have already become alarmingly frequent since 2016, could become an annual occurrence by the 2040s if high greenhouse gas emissions continue. These bleaching events, driven by sustained heat stress, significantly reduce coral cover and biodiversity.</p>

  <p>In parallel, long-term sea-level rise is expected to exacerbate erosion and impact coastal ecosystems surrounding the reef, although the reef itself offers limited protection once its living structure is compromised. If current trends persist, large portions of the Great Barrier Reef could shift from vibrant, biodiverse ecosystems to degraded reef flats dominated by algae and coral rubble within decades. While partial restoration may be possible through intensive management, large-scale degradation is projected to occur by mid- to late-century under high-emission scenarios.</p>

  <p class="neg fst-italic">The timeline for these shifts varies by region and local conditions, but experts emphasize that the window for witnessing the reef in its current form is narrowing significantly.</p>

availability: >
  Current itineraries reflect experiences that may become increasingly rare in the coming decades. Guests are encouraged to consider near-term travel opportunities while the reef remains accessible in its present state. Future availability will depend on the pace of environmental change, the effectiveness of conservation measures, and potential regulatory restrictions. Experiences offered through The Archive Reef Collection are currently in early-stage development and may be subject to revision based on ecological conditions, preservation policy, and scientific advisement.
