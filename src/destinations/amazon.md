  <p>At current deforestation rates, 40% of the Amazon rainforest could be lost by 2050. A tipping point may be reached as early as 2030–2040, beyond which the basin could transition into dry savannah.</p>
  <p class="neg fst-italic">The Amazon’s role as a climate stabilizer is rapidly diminishing.</p>
availability: >
  Guests are encouraged to experience the Amazon’s unmatched biodiversity while intact habitats remain accessible. Future experiences will increasingly shift toward virtual preservation.
